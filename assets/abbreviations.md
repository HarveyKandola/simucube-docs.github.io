*[load cell]: Load cell is a sensor that measures force
*[linear actuator]: A motor driven linear guide
*[Tuner]: A free configuration sofware tool for Simucube wheelbase devices
*[Tuner]: A free configuration sofware tool for Simucube Link based devices, such as ActivePedal
*[rig]: A.k.a. cockpit or a rigid frame where sim racing components, such as a seat, wheel and pedals, are mounted to.
*[rigs]: A.k.a. cockpit or a rigid frame where sim racing components, such as a seat, wheel and pedals, are mounted to.
*[damping]: A physical property of mechanical structure that helps vibration, or "singing", to attenuate/fade out naturally. Examples of high damping materials are cast iron, wood, concrete and alike, while low damping is exhibited in "springy" materials such as steel. However springy materials can also make well damped system when made rigid enough and/or with addition of some damping materials in their structure.
*[oscillation]: A physical vibration phenomenon that may occur in dynamically controlled systems. Frequency of vibration may vary from low frequency shaking motion to high pitched audible tone. Using well damped mechanical structures and/or using software vibration reduction features are typical ways to mitigate oscillation.
*[passive pedal]: A sim racing pedal type that is based on non-powered components, such as hydraulics, elastomers or springs, to produce the pedal force.
