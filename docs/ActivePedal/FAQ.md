??? question "Which rigs are compatible with ActivePedal?"

    Rig compatibility depends just on mechanical fitting and mounting, which means that nearly all rigs are compatible at least with some installation effort. To get an idea, see  [Mounting](../Mounting).

    However, not all rigs are created equal. One quality aspect of rig is their rigidity and their vibration damping properties. Typically worst ones in this sense are thin and/or flexible metal structure rigs, while in other hand rigid metallic or plywood rigs exhibit high vibration damping. This may affect the quality of feeling, and in worst case could cause oscillation issues.
