    
Profiles are configuration sets of one or multiple pedals. Profiles can be used to save your pedal configurations and/or share them. Profiles have all the configurations of each pedal e.g. roles, force curves, travels and effects.

Profiles can be found in device panel, on top of all devices.


## Quick start guide

Name your profile and press save. Now the profile can be found from profile catalog (LOAD list). 

## Tags

User can add tags which describe the profile and also write a description what the profile does. Tags can be added either by pressing a section of Tags and selecting corresponding tag or by searching tags from tag categories by writing a filter for them.

### Tag categories

- Game
- Car class
- Car
- Other

## Buttons

- Save: Saves current profile to a local file.
- Clone: Clones a current profile so that it can be edited without changing the original profile.
- Load: Load a profile from a profile catalog which is saved on a computer. Loading is done by double-clicking profile.
- Import: Import a profile to local profile catalog.
- Export: Export a profile for sharing.

## Templates

Templates are integrated profiles which cannot be changed. If you want to use a template as a base for profile then just clone it and you have a base for a new profile.


## Autosaving

Current pedal configuration is continuously autosaved. This means that the configuration is always as it should be, even though the Tuner is restarted for whatever reason.
