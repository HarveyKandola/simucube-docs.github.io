When the device tab is viewed for the very first time, the device configuration windows is displayed automatically, and calibration is forced. After this, the configuration can be launched from a configure -button on top of the device window.

!!! Info
    Follow the setup procedure in the following order.

## 1. Set physical configuration

There are two configurations on the configuration panel which need to match the physical ActivePedal configuration. These are:

1. Force adjustment piece position: High / Low
2. Rod length (3 positions): Short / Middle / Long

Match the physical configuration and the configuration seen in the software.

## 2. Set pedal starting position

Set pedal starting position by moving pedal rest position slider. Pedal moves to the position when mouse button is released. The pedal starting position affects on maximum movement range of the pedal. Therefore it is usually wanted to have the rest position pretty forward. The rest position can be used to level all the pedals to same plane.

## 3. Set pedal role

Pedal role drop-down menu is used to select the role of the pedal. i.e. Brake, Throttle or Clutch. If two pedals have same role or the role has not been selected then it is indicated as configuration error (Yellow circle).

## 4. Perform calibration

The ActivePedal calibration measures forces during calibration to accomodate all kinds of installations. The calibration is started by pressing "Calibrate force sensor" -button.

It is recommended to calibrate the force sensor everytime the ActivePedal is moved/reattached and/or when the physical rod-configuration is changed.

!!! Info
    Do not press or move pedal when performing calibration or while saving configuration. Instead let pedal stay untouched until the calibration dialog is closed.
