When the ActivePedal is correctly configured, the main adjustment window is seen. 

The main feature of the ActivePedal is the limitless possibility to adjust the pedal feel. This is done solely with the Tuner software.

### Force curve

The force which is felt on the pedal on travel range is adjusted by adjusting the force curve. Force curve adjustment is done by moving force curve "nodes". The pedal feel can be tested "on the fly" after releasing the press from the node.

There is virtual backwall after the travel range which stops the movement so there is no worry that a user might push the pedal too much.

### Pedal travel

Below the force curve there is a pedal travel slider. Pedal travel slider defines the maximum range of the pedal movement. The force curve is then adjusted to this range.

The travel is calculated from the center of the pedal face and it follows circle circumference.

### Maximum force of the curve.

On right side of the force curve there is curve maximum force -slider. This sets the force which is felt at the top of the force curve grid.

### Preload

Preload is on the left side of the force curve. It means the force that is needed for pedal to start moving from the rest position. This can be used to rest your foot on the pedal without activating it.

One method to set preload is to rest your feet on the pedal and raise the preload until pedal is in the rest position.

### Curve presets

On top of the force curve there is curve-preset buttons which set the force curve in a predefined way. These only adjust the force curve and do not affect on travel or force settings.

- Linear
- Squared
- S-curve
- Logarithmic A
- Logarithmic B
- Logarithmic C

### Import from templates / profiles

Pedal feel from an existing profile can be imported from a "hamburger" menu which is at the top right corner of the Pedal feel -section. By importing feel from profile; the travel, maximum force, force curve, preload, damping and simulaton input mapping will change.

## Passive effects

Passive effects mean the effects which modify how the pedal feel. These are not game effects and therefore work in all cases.

### Damping

Damping removes the "springiness" from the pedal feel by resisting fast changes in velocity.

### Friction (static friction)

This passive effect can be useful in throttle. It gives stickyness when starting to move the pedal from stop position. Strength means how sticky it is and smoothness means how tough the movement from stickyness is.

    Will potentially change in the future.
