# Simucube Throttle

The new Simucube Throttle is the perfect additional pedal for someone, who already has an ActivePedal, but doesn't currently want to invest on a force feedback pedal for throttle. 
The wide array of mechanical adjustments give you the experience of manually setting the pedal to your personal liking.
